# My CFD Journey (Portfolio)

A curated CFD portfolio with reproducible case setups, automation scripts, and KPI post-processing.

## Projects

### 1) CHT Heat Exchanger Automation (OpenFOAM)
**Location:** `Projects/cht-heat-exchanger-automation/`  
**Highlights:** multi-region CHT, parametric sweep (U, T), automated KPI extraction and comparison plots.  
**How to run:** see the project README / `sweep_parallel.sh`.

## Notes on reproducibility
- Large generated data (meshes `polyMesh`, solver outputs, `postProcessing`, `processor*`) is intentionally excluded from Git.
- The repository contains the full setup + scripts needed to reproduce results.

## Certificates
See `Certificates/`.
